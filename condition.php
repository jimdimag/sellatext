    Many new books come with an access code. An access code is a password to access course content online, and expires after use. Most books have optional online content,
    and can still be used once the access code has expired. However, some books, such as Hybrid editions, cannot be used without the online component.
    If your book requires use of the online course material, and cannot be used without accessing the online material, we will not be able to buy the book.
    If the book is still usable without an access code/access card/online registration code, we will be deducting<b> 25%</b> from the buyback quote. </div>
